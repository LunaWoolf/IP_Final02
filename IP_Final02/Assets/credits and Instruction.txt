Design Brief:

This is a rhythm game. The original idea is to make something that is playful and also beautiful to just look at. The track is procedural generate and will be different each time, same as the note sheet. I hope you enjoy this game.

How to Play:
Please start from the "Start Scene"
Press the according arrow key when the arrows fall to the pink little box's area. The traveling of the camera has noting to do with the input, it's self-pathfinding. It makes the background of the game looks beautiful and dynamtic. (If you don't want to play, you can just enjoy it goes till the end of the song.)

Note:
There are two branches in this project. Please pull from the "Reuse-Note" branch for the latest version, Not the mater branch. Thank you.
The "master" branch generate notes every beat and destroy the gameObject after it has been hit/miss.
The "Reuse-note" brach generate a list of different types of notes at beginning and reuse them. Therefore it won't cause garbage collection and make the game run smoother.
